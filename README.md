## 🧮 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Start Typing
When the user begins typing, a 60-second countdown starts automatically.

### 2️⃣ Character Comparison
Every input character is compared against the target text:
- ✅ Correct → Green  
- ❌ Incorrect → Red and underlined  

### 3️⃣ WPM Formula
(Each 5 characters are considered one word.)
